# homeassistant-addons
A repository of my components for Home Assistant to be consumed as Addons.


## Untested

I don't currently have a Pi setup with HAOS (I run HASS on an Arch server in
docker with all my services configured by compose). I have received requests
for addon support so I am putting up this repo to satisfy that. I will try and
get this tested when I can.
